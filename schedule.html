<h2> What a Session looks like </h2>

<p>
  There will be an option to give a 25 min session or a 50 min session.
  The session topics can cover a variety of topics.
  Special equipment is not necessary to give a talk but if you'd like media,
  please let our schedulers know as not all of our rooms will be equipped with the same things.
</p>
<p>
  The process for signing up is simple; you will be given a sticky note
  (a whole one for a full session and a half one for half a session).
  Write the topic you will be speaking about and your name.
  Then place the sticky note in the timeslot you would like to speak in.
</p>
<p>
  Attendees will be given the opportunity to vote for the sessions they plan on going to.
  This will give the schedulers a good idea of what room size to place you in.
