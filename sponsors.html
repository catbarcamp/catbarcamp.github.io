<h2>Becoming a Sponsor</h2>

Becoming a CAT Barcamp sponsor is a great way to support an awesome event. To ask questions about sponsoring <a href="mailto:catbarcamp@cat.pdx.edu"> catbarcamp@cat.pdx.edu</a>.

<h3>What your money will be spent on</h3>

CAT Barcamp is entirely run by volunteers; no one is taking a salary for its production. Funds will be spent to provide a refreshments throughout the day, tee shirts, lasercut keychains, and stickers for all participants. Any funds remaining will be rolled over into the funding for the next CAT Barcamp, the following Fall.

<h3>Who will be there</h3>

TheCAT at PSU is an ops training organization that is happy to help secure the venue and organize the event. We expect many job-hungry students skilled in development, computer science, operations, and everything else to be in attendance at this event and we want to enable as many connections as possible.

<h2>Benefits of Becoming a Sponsor</h2>

Most of the attendees of this conference are not purchasers or decision makers, but they are the next generation of engineers. This is a great opportunity for your recruitment team to meet the students and for the students to meet your companies. For sponsors, we can provide a table in the atrium where everyone will gather in the morning, at lunch, and at breaks. We will feature your name/logo prominently it all posters/media/t-shirt, and we will recognize you formally at the morning opening speech.
