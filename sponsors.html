<h2>Becoming a Sponsor</h2>

Becoming a CAT Barcamp sponsor is a great way to support an awesome event. To ask questions about sponsoring <a href="mailto:catbarcamp@cat.pdx.edu"> catbarcamp@cat.pdx.edu</a>.

<h3>What your money will be spent on</h3>

CAT BarCamp is entirely run by volunteers; no one is taking a salary for its production. Funds will be spent to provide a morning snack, refreshments throughout the day, lunch at noon for attendees, and a tee shirt for all participants. Any funds remaining will be rolled over into the funding for CAT BarCamp 2, next September.

<h3>Who will be there</h3>

TheCAT at PSU is an ops training organization that is happy to help secure the venue and organize the event. We expect many job-hungry students skilled in development, computer science, operations, and everything else to be in attendance at this event and we want to enable as many connections as possible.

<h2>Benefits of Becoming a Sponsor</h2>

Most of the attendees of this conference are not purchasers or decision makers, but they are the next generation of engineers. This is a great opportunity for your recruitment team to meet the students and for the students to meet your companies. For sponsors, we can provide a table in the atrium where everyone will gather in the morning, at lunch, and at breaks. We will feature your name/logo prominently it all posters/media/t-shirt, and we will recognize you formally at the morning opening speech. For sponsors at the "Gold" level or higher, we can dedicate a 50 minute session to you for whatever you want to do, including a "meet the engineers" session or a product demo.
