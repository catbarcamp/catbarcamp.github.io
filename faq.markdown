### Is RSVPing required?
RSVPing is not required to attend the event but we would appreciate anyone who would like to attend to register at our eventbrite site (link here) to give our planners a better idea of how many people will be participating.

### Will there be WiFi?
Yes, the PSU campus has a “PSU Guest” wifi option.

### What should I bring?
There is nothing that is required but there are a few recommended things. Such as note-taking supplies, a laptop/tablet, and a sweater/rain proof layer.

### Who to contact to receive accommodations relating to a disability?
Please make a note of any accommodations you might need and the best way to reach you while registering for the event. One of our planners will contact you.

Not at all. Although we encourage everyone to participate by speaking we would also like this to be a fun experience. Therefore if you’re not comfortable presenting feel free to simply meet new people and learn something new!
