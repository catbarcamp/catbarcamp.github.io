### Where do I park?
Although parking will not be provided by the event, attendees may use designated street parking and the PSU parking structures for a fee. 

### Is RSVPing required?
RSVPing is not required to attend the event but we would appreciate anyone who would like to attend to register (link soon to be provided) to give our planners a better idea of how many people will be participating.

### Will there be WiFi?
Yes, the PSU campus has a “PSU Guest” wifi option.

### What should I bring?
There is nothing that is required but there are a few recommended things. Such as note-taking supplies, a laptop/tablet, and a sweater/rain proof layer.

### Who to contact to receive accommodations relating to a disability?
Please contact us at catbarcamp@cat.pdx.edu with questions and a description of the accomodation you will need. One of our planners will respond to the email confirming we recieved your request and the accomodations will be met

### Do I have to present?
Not at all. Although we encourage everyone to participate by speaking we would also like this to be a fun experience. Therefore if you’re not comfortable presenting feel free to simply meet new people and learn something new!

### What about Restrooms?
In the Engineering Building there are a set of restrooms on every floor. In the Fourth Avenue Building restrooms can be found towards the middle of the basement floor (near Circuits Lounge) and towards the harrison St. entrance. We realize maneuvering the buildings can be tricky so feel free to ask one of our volunteers in you need assistance.
