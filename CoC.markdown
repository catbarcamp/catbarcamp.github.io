## Our Mission
TheCAT is dedicated to providing a respectful and harassment-free experience for all CAT BarCamp participants, regardless of e.g. gender, orientation, ability, appearance, race, age, or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form, including but not limited to deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, sustained disruption of talks or other events, intentionally recording someone who has declined to be recorded, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Sexually explicit imagery is not appropriate at this event. Anyone who is asked to stop a harassing behavior at CAT BarCamp is expected to comply immediately.

## Who This Policy Applies To
This policy applies to everyone at CAT BarCamp, including CATs, visitors, and other members of the Portland State community. 
It is in addition to the [Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment Policy](http://www.pdx.edu/diversity/sites/www.pdx.edu.diversity/files/3.15.13%20REV%20Policy%20on%20Prohibited%20Discrimination%20and%20Harassment%20signed%20final.pdf) which PSU students, staff, and faculty have already agreed to.

## Enforcement
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, theCAT may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender. If you are being harassed, notice someone else being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a CAT BarCamp volunteer or organizer. We will be happy to help a person experiencing harassment to contact campus security or law enforcement, provide an escort, or otherwise assist them in feeling safe for the rest of the event.
