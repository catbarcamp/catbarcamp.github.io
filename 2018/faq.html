      <h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="who-should-go-to-cat-barcamp">Who should go to CAT Barcamp?</h3>
<p>Everyone! CAT Barcamp is not just for nerds, engineering students, or PSU students. CAT Barcamp is open to anyone who wants to come.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-talks-going-to-be-about">What are the talks going to be about?</h3>
<p>We won’t know for sure until the day of! The participants (that’s you!) choose what they’d like to talk about when they show up on Saturday morning! Part of the fun of a barcamp is seeing what topics end up being presented on! Last year had topics ranging from webcomics to tabletop gaming to ethical software to cold weather survival to vim commands to music coding!</p>

<h3 id="do-i-have-to-present">Do I have to present?</h3>
<p>Not at all! Feel free to come and just listen to others. There is no obligation or expectation for every participant to also be a presenter.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-present-on-">Can I present on <thing>?</thing></h3>
<p>Probably! As long as your topic is worksafe and appropriate for all ages, you’re free to present on it. Your topic does not have to be tech related just because the hosting organization (The CAT) is an IT department. If you want to check on a topic before you present it, feel free to contact us and we’ll confirm whether or not it would be appropriate at CAT BarCamp.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-i-park">Where do I park?</h3>
<p>Although parking will not be provided by the event, attendees may use designated street parking and the PSU parking structures for a fee.</p>

<h3 id="is-rsvping-required">Is RSVPing required?</h3>
<p>RSVPing is not required to attend the event but we would appreciate anyone who would like to attend to register <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cat-barcamp-2016-tickets-24878488228">Eventbrite</a> to give our planners a better idea of how many people will be participating.</p>

<h3 id="will-there-be-wifi">Will there be WiFi?</h3>
<p>Yes, the PSU campus has a “PSU Guest” wifi option.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-bring">What should I bring?</h3>
<p>There are no necessities, but you may find note-taking equipment, rain gear, and a snack useful.</p>

<h3 id="who-to-contact-to-receive-accommodations-relating-to-a-disability">Who to contact to receive accommodations relating to a disability?</h3>
<p>Please contact us at catbarcamp@cat.pdx.edu with questions and a description of the accommodation you will need. One of our planners will respond to the email confirming we received your request and we will proceed with discussing accomodations.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-restrooms">What about Restrooms?</h3>
<p>In the Engineering Building there are a set of restrooms on every floor. In the Fourth Avenue Building restrooms can be found towards the middle of the basement floor (near Circuits Lounge) and towards the harrison St. entrance. We realize maneuvering the buildings can be tricky so feel free to ask one of our volunteers if you need assistance.</p>
