 * Software:
   * GIMP
   * MyPaint
   * Inkscape (optional, but awesome for vector art)
   * Photoshop (optional, this tutorial is written with GIMP and MyPaint in mind but all of the concepts involved can be directly translated to being used with Photoshop)
   
## Prepare your lineart

One way or another prepare the picture that you desire to color. I might do a introductory tutorial on this later and update this section with a link to it here.

Regardless of how you do your line art, unless you are highly confident or have a style that makes it okay, I highly recommend doing your sketch in pencil and doing the final inking in a seperate step.
