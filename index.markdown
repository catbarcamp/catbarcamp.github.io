## Like other Unconferences, CATBarCamp is:

### Open to everyone
CatBarCamp is not only for PSU students! Anyone who has an interest in being involved may attend.

### Has no charge to attend
In the spirit of the Open Source Community Bar Camps are free of charge. All we ask is that you register so that our planners have an idea of how many attendees to expect.

### Has sessions
The sessions at a Bar Camp are as unpredictable as the Oregon weather. They can be on various topics, from technology-oriented dev ops to non technology oriented 'How to make the BEST grilled cheese EVER!'.

### Unscheduled
Bar Camps are unscheduled which means that the topics for sessions are not pre-determined. The timeslots for the sessions however are. Everyone gets a chance to pick a timeslot in which to speak in throughout the unconference.
